# alx-backend-storage

## Introduction
The "alx-backend-storage" repository is designed to explore and understand various backend storage systems. This project covers a range of storage technologies, from relational databases to NoSQL databases, and includes practical exercises to apply the concepts learned. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how different storage solutions work and how to implement them effectively in backend applications.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the fundamentals of relational and non-relational databases.
- Learn how to design, implement, and manage different types of storage solutions.
- Gain hands-on experience with SQL and NoSQL databases.
- Explore the use of storage solutions in real-world applications.
- Enhance your skills in data modeling, querying, and optimization.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on different storage technologies and concepts:

1. **Relational Databases**: Introduction to SQL, data modeling, normalization, and management of relational databases.
2. **NoSQL Databases**: Understanding NoSQL paradigms, including document-based, key-value, column-family, and graph databases.
3. **Data Warehousing**: Concepts and implementation of data warehouses and OLAP systems.
4. **Distributed Storage**: Exploring distributed storage systems and their applications.
5. **Cloud Storage**: Utilization of cloud-based storage solutions.

## Modules and Tasks
### 1. Relational Databases
- **SQL Basics**: Introduction to SQL syntax, CRUD operations.
- **Advanced SQL**: Joins, subqueries, indexes, and transactions.
- **Database Design**: Schema design, normalization, and ER diagrams.

### 2. NoSQL Databases
- **Document Stores**: MongoDB, CouchDB.
- **Key-Value Stores**: Redis, DynamoDB.
- **Column-Family Stores**: Cassandra, HBase.
- **Graph Databases**: Neo4j, ArangoDB.

### 3. Data Warehousing
- **Data Warehousing Concepts**: ETL processes, star and snowflake schemas.
- **OLAP Operations**: Online analytical processing, data cubes.

### 4. Distributed Storage
- **Distributed File Systems**: HDFS, Ceph.
- **Distributed Databases**: CockroachDB, Google Spanner.

### 5. Cloud Storage
- **AWS S3**: Basics of S3, bucket policies, and lifecycle management.
- **Google Cloud Storage**: GCS basics, IAM, and data retention policies.

## Files
Each module contains a set of files and directories organized as follows:
- **Module_X/**: Directory for module X, where X is the module number.
  - **README.md**: Overview and objectives of the module.
  - **examples/**: Example scripts and configurations.
  - **exercises/**: Practical exercises and tasks to complete.
  - **solutions/**: Solution files for the exercises.
